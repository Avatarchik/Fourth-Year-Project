Fourth-Year-Project
===================

Turn based fantasy game that was submitted for my final year project in Dublin Institute of Technology for a BSc Level 8 in Computer Science.

This was submitted along with a dissertation and I recieved my Degree this year, 2014.

The project was created using Unity3D. All coding done, unless where stated otherwise, was done by me. 

The coding language used was C#. I read through the Third Person Controller class and found the way of running to be incorrect if being used with anything other than a keyboard. This was changed to suit my own needs.

The character models used in this can be found on the Unity asset store.

This project was made for the OUYA console.
